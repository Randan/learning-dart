# Learning Dart

A project for learning Dart programming language as part of the **Flutter Mobile Developer** course at **r_d (Robot Dreams)** school.

## Course Information

- **Course**: Flutter Mobile Developer
- **School**: r_d (Robot Dreams)
- **Instructor**: [Pavlo Avdonin](https://github.com/OnlyTarg)

## Project Structure

This project contains various lessons and exercises for learning Dart:

- `bin/` - Entry point for the application
- `lib/` - Library code and lesson modules
  - `lesson_6/` - Operators and Control Flow
  - `lesson_8/` - Collections and Data Structures
  - `lesson_9/` - Object-Oriented Programming
  - `lesson_11/` - Asynchronous Programming and Streams
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helper code

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Make sure you have Dart SDK installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `dart pub get` to install dependencies
4. Execute the main application with `dart run`

## Learning Progress

This repository tracks my progress through the Dart programming language fundamentals, covering:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Control flow and functions
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Collections and generics
- Asynchronous programming with Futures and Streams
- Optional parameters and default values
- Null safety and nullable types
- And more...

## Recent Learning Topics

- **Asynchronous Programming**: Learned about Futures, async/await patterns, and Stream processing
- **Streams**: Explored different ways to work with streams including StreamController and periodic streams
- **Code Internationalization**: Translated all Ukrainian text to English for better code accessibility
- **Optional Parameters**: Learned how to create functions with optional positional parameters using square brackets `[]` and default values
- **Null Safety**: Practiced handling nullable types and proper null checking
- **Utility Functions**: Created reusable helper functions for common tasks

## Code Quality

All code is written in English and follows Dart best practices with proper linting configuration. The project uses `analysis_options.yaml` to ensure code quality and consistency.
